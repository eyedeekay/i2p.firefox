* .bat Script: Detect location of C:\Program Files\I2P or
 C\Program Files(x86)\I2P in launcher scripts
* NSIS changes
 - Make launcher scripts static artifacts instead of generating them during
  the install process
 - If a jpackaged I2P router is present in $checkout/I2P, include it in an
  installer.
 - If a running installer doesn't find an I2P router in Program Files, install
  the jpackaged I2P router. Mark it as jpackaged so we can quickly determine
  from other applications.

* I2P Jpackage
 - support for building an I2P Jpackage has been added to the build system
  Note that support is platform-specific, to build a Windows jpackage one must
  use a Windows OS, to build a Linux jpackage one must use a Linux OS. Only
  Windows jpackages are used for a release product.
 - For information about how releases are built see README.md and UPDATES.md
 - The jpackaged router has the following differences from mainline I2P:
  - The jars are installed to a different directory.
  - The native libraries are installed to a different directory
  - The wrapper script is not installed and not used, and replaced by the
   browser launcher.
  - The I2P executable is %programfiles%/I2P/I2P.exe, command-line flags are not
   compatible but configuration files are.
  - wrapper.config is unused
  - The built-by entry will reflect that idk built the package
  - Use flags to achieve compatibility with plugins that use Reflection on Java
