# I2P Easy-Install Bundle for Windows 2.4.9

This is a pre-release of the I2P Easy-Install Bundle for Windows.
This changes how the I2P bundle and browser profile manager are installed and integrated with the host system.
The Easy-Install bundle is now a "portable" system that can be moved to different locations within or between Windows file-systems while retaining all built-in functionality.
A shortcut for starting the I2P router is still provided by the installer for convenience, but the shortcuts for starting the I2P Browser are now integrated with the I2P desktop UI.
