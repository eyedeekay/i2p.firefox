To build this, you will need the following software packages (all available in Debian) :

* make
* nsis
* dos2unix
* curl

Before you build, you should update the files "NoScript.url"
and "i2psetproxy.url" to point to the latest direct download
links of the respective plugins. "HTTPSEverywhere.url" now
points to the latest stable version of "HTTPS Everywhere" at
all times. If those have changed, `make clean` to ensure that
up to date versions are used in the build.

After that just type "make".  This will produce two files:

profile.tgz - the firefox profile, plus a shell script which will
launch it if Firefox is found in the $PATH on Unix-Like operating
systems.
install.exe - the windows installer, which sets up shortcuts to
launch Firefox on Windows.

To report issues against this browser profile, please file issues
at [the official Gitlab](https://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.firefox)
or the [Github Mirror](https://github.com/i2p/i2p.firefox). Issues
pertaining to the plugins may be reported to their upstream
maintainers if it's determined that our configuration is not at
fault.
