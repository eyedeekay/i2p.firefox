    <h1>
      Setting up an Update Server for an I2P Bundle
    </h1>
    <p>
      It is important to set up a signed update server so that people are able to
      safely and anonymously update your I2P bundle.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The quick way:
    </h2>
    <p>
      This process depends on my ability to push releases to github. If you are
      forking, setting up a dev server, or taking over because I got hit by a bus,
      youâ€™ll need to do it the complete way.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as long as I am building updates, you will be able to mirror the jpackaged
      Windows bundle by cloning the repository
      <code>
        https://github.com/eyedeekay/i2p
      </code>
      and
      running the
      <code>
        make docker run
      </code>
      target in that repository. You can retrieve the
      base32 address of your update server by viewing the log with
      <code>
        docker logs eephttpd-jpackage | grep b32.i2p | tee eephttpd-address.md
      </code>
      . To
      update the site, run
      <code>
        ./update.site.sh
      </code>
      in that repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have cloned the repository and started the container with
      <code>
        make docker run
      </code>
      , you can simply add
      <code>
        path/to/repo/update-site.sh
      </code>
      to your
      <code>
        crontab
      </code>
      and it will update at an interval of your choosing.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The complete way:
    </h2>
    <p>
      TODO: describe how to do it with less of the awesome fancy stuff I put together
      to make it easier on myself to keep an update server going.
