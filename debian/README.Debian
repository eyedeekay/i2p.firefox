i2p-firefox-profile for Debian
-----------------------------

This is a Firefox Profile and a bundle of Open-Source extensions which are
packaged for convenience as a Debian-style package. The extensions themselves
may not be packaged in Debian. They are side-loaded on the first run of the
browser profile.
